# DevOps_Orange
This repository contains the results of our [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr) Engineering school project with [Orange](https://www.orange.com) (everything is in French), the French Telecom company on a Deep Learning based audio assessment service called [NISQA](https://github.com/gabrielmittag/NISQA). The proof of concept given to Orange is under NDA and detained by them only. However, these are the results given to the school as a proof of our work.
